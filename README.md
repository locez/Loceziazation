# Loceziazation

Loceziazation is my personal dotfiles repository. It contains my configuration files for various applications and tools that I use on a daily basis. The goal of this repository is to provide a convenient way to manage and share my dotfiles across different machines.

It is a mistake about the name of this repository. It should be "Locezlization" but I made a typo when I created it and I didn't want to change it because its pronunciation sounds cuter. So I decided to keep it as is.

## Installation
To install Loceziazation, simply using `yadm` to clone the repository and symlink the dotfiles to your home directory. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Install yadm
sudo emerge -a yadm
# Clone the repository
yadm clone git@github.com:locez/Loceziazation.git
```
